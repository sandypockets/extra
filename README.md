## Database

Extra currently uses an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) database. While this is sufficient for development of the core features, eventually the app will be migrated to [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) so it can be deployed.

An ERD of the database can be found in the project's `docs/` directory.
