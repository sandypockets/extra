## ðŸ—‚ Database

Extra currently uses an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) database. While this is sufficient for development of the core features, eventually the app will be migrated to [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) so it can be deployed.

An ERD of the database can be found in the project's `docs/` directory.

In some instances you may need to reset the database, or make manual changes. To do that, follow the instructions below.

1. Reload the database from the schema.

```
$ rake db:reset
```

2. Drop the current tables, recreate them, run the migrations, and any seeds.

```
$ rake db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

Any data that was not included in a seed should now be wiped. 

### Adjusting the database manually
Sometimes you might need to set a user as an admin manually. You can do that with the Rails Console. 
```
$ rails console
```
1. Set the user you want to change as a variable
```
$ @user = User.find_by(username: "kobe")
```
2. Confirm you have the correct user by running the variable. The user's information should print to the terminal.
```
$ @user
```
3. Now you can proceed with adjusting the user's admin privileges. 
```
$ @user.is_admin = true
```
4. Printing `@user` again should now show the user's admin status is `true`. Next, save the changes to the database.
```
$ @user.save
```
5. You can exit the Rails Console with `control`+`d`

## ðŸš€ Project Roadmap
Stretch features to be implemented at a later date:
* Users can favourite topics
* Users can see which topics other users have marked as favourite
* Password reset emails
* Migrate front end from ERB to React
